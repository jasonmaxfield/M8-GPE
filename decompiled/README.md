## Apktool (de)compile
Easily decompile or compile based on if input is directory or file. 

### How-to

- If decompiling, move file to this directory.
- Drag and drop file or folder onto script.
- **OR** Run this from command:

        apktool.bat input_folder_or_file

### Notes
This will force decompilation which will overwrite any folders.

Builds with original AndroidManifest.xml and META-INF which means what is output in dist folder is good to go.
